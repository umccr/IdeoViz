## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(IdeoViz)
require(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r}
data(binned_multiSeries)
ideo <- getIdeo("hg18")
head(ideo)
plotOnIdeo(chrom=seqlevels(binned_multiSeries), # which chrom to plot?
           ideoTable=ideo, # ideogram name
           values_GR=binned_multiSeries, # data goes here
           value_cols=1, # col to plot
           col=brewer.pal(n=5, 'Spectral'), # colours
           val_range=c(0,3),
           plotType = 'rect', # set y-axis range
           ylab="array intensities",
           plot_title="Trendline example")
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
